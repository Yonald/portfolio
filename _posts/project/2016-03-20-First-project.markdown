# Valentines day - 2016

I decided that this year since Jess and I have been dating for coming up to 2 years now that I would make her a cute little app to show her how much she means to me (and an excuse to make something for myself!)

It needed to be responsive since Jess spends more time browsing the internet on the phone than on her desktop.
