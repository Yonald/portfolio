## Bootstrap 3

Bootstrap has been around for years now however I haven't had much of a chance to really make something from scratch with it. Sure I've used some CDNs from [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/) for some of the dailyui challenges however I wanted to make a real page.

The idea came from an office joke which I played on one of my coleagues and the buttons link are strickly innocent!
