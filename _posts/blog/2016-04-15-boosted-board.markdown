Is it a bird?, is it a plane? Err. No it’s a bloke on an electric skateboard.

Ever since Marty McFly and the hoverboard appeared in 1985 film Back to the Future it has been the dream of mine to own one. Well, one small hope for man has turned into a giant leap for skateboard kind.

They have turned a standard long board skateboard in a cruising and commuter machine. Using a ‘Loaded’ flexible bamboo 38inch skateboard deck and slung beneath is the discreet lithium iron batteries and powerful brushless DC motors drive their top of the range board to a bladder emptying 22mph.

Originally electric boards were heavy cumbersome affairs with a clunky metal body running the length of the board housing all the controls, battery and motors making the ride similar to an iron girder with wheels.

The story of Boosted Boards bringing this product to market is an epic example of turning a vision into reality. Using the crowd funding website Kickstarter the company obtained funds from loyal investors hoping for their own next generation electric board.

All I need to do now is get my hands on one and turn this dream into a reality!
