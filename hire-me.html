		<p>The thing I enjoy the most is making a difference to other people with my work, nothing feels better than helping a business grow through the internet! I am experienced in working with HTML / CSS / JavaScript.</p>

		<p>I started out in IT support which is where I learnt all about customer service and that providing a great service (or resolving issues properly when things aren't so great) is vital in any industry. Honesty is key, if I can't do something I will tell you I haven't done this before but I can and will learn it.</p>
